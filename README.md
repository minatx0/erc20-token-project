This repository contains a deployment script for the ERC-20 token contract "MyToken" using Hardhat, a popular Ethereum development tool. The script is written in JavaScript and is designed to automate the process of compiling the smart contract, deploying it to a designated test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten), and logging the deployed contract address for future interactions. It provides a comprehensive guide through each step of the deployment process, starting from initializing the Hardhat environment to handling potential errors that might arise during deployment. The script is thoroughly commented to ensure clarity and ease of understanding for developers at different skill levels, making it an essential tool for anyone looking to deploy smart contracts efficiently in the Ethereum ecosystem.
